# Securing a Communication Channel with SSL

## Description
This program will simulate a secure communication channel using SSL. The program uses certificates
that I have created using the first command in the files to create a private and public key. Then I
used the second command to export this key to "keystore.p12". This allowed me to then import the
created private key to XCA and create the requried "Bill.crt" certificate using this key. I then
created the server (Jill.crt) and Client (Chris.crt) certificates using their own 2048 bit RSA key
that was generated by XCA. Then I exported these certificates off XCA into the task 1 file and used
the third command to put them into a keystore called "test" that was hardcoded into the files. Both
the server and client files use these keys to verify each other. 

## Running the programs

To run the program you will need 2 terminals open and use the following commands:

```sh
java Server.java
```

It will say that is listening on a port, which means you are ready to start the client with:

```sh
java Client.java
```

The server and client will exchange messages and output what they got from eachother. When checking
the interceeptor you can see that it has captured the messages however the values will be encrypted.
